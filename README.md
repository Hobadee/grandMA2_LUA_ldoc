# grandMA2_LUA_ldoc
LDoc for the grandMA2 API, since their API is poorly documented.

Compiled version at:
http://static.impactsf.com/GrandMA2/

Note, this version is hosted by a previous employer and may be out of date.  I have contacts there still so will try to have them keep it up-to-date, but please check the last updated time.


## Building

To build this LDoc, simply run `ldoc .` in the root project directory

## Source

These functions were found in a piece of demo code from MA located in the ProgramData for onPC.  On my computer that is located at:
`C:\ProgramData\MA Lighting Technologies\grandma\gma2_V_3.9\plugins\plugin_1.lua`
